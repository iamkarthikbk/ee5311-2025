prof updated the problem statement to:
Instead of creating a single standard cell that generates both Cout and Sum using A_i, B_i, C_in as inputs, create separate layouts for the sum and carry parts. Try and implement two versions of the carry logic. 

First with inputs A_i, B_i and C_in and generates (C_out complement)
Second one takes A_i, B_i and (C_in complement) as input and complements both A_i and B_i inside the layout and generates C_out
These two layouts are due next Thursday(April 3).

Generate separate layouts for Sum logic similarly. Use the carry layouts to construct the layout of the ripple carry adder critical path. The complete layout is due on April 10.
